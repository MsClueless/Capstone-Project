        <h1>Trying to be a self-taught web developer</h1>

        <main>

            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Tami, not soooo young anymore, and for the past 20 years I've worked in the same (boring) job in the legal department
                of a media company (but I'm not really ambitious, I like my work-life-balance, thank you very much).
                When Covid hit in early 2020, we were sent to work from home, and, since work slowed down, I started playing around with the
            idea of learning how to code. I had no prior experience whatsoever, and I'm not particular tech-savvy, but I've always like working
        on the computer, so...why not give it a shot?</p>

            <h2>How it started...</h2>
            <p>I found - rather accidentally, I think it was one of Amazon's monthly ebook deals - an ebook that taught children how to code.
               That was fun trying and getting to know some of the basics; and yes, when it is explained to you like you're a child, even
               a non-tech person like me understood it! Since I enjoyed this, I thought, why not expand on this and check for any courses
               online (because any kind of courses at university were out of the question). So, I found freeCodeCamp, Codecademy (even became
               a pro-member!) The Odin Project, and, lately, AppAcademy Open.
            </p>
            <h2>How it's going...</h2>
            <p>I've been through HTML and CSS a couple of times now, and for me, it doesn't feel like I'm stuck in tutorial hell because I keep
                learning new stuff, repeating stuff I've learned before but couldn't (or not quite) remember, so this helps me feel more comfortable.
                And of course - practice is key! BUT THEN...along came...JavaScript. And I feel SO stuck... Mostly I get the explanations, but once
                I have to apply it - oh boy. Rock Paper Scissors anyone? That's where I'm stuck at The Odin Project, and I kind of took a break over
                the summer. (Also, I just couldn't concentrate because I cannot stand the heat.) Got back into coding in September thanks to the
                freeCodeCamp bootcamp (thanks, Jess and Ramon, event though I still have to go through - you guessed it - the JavaScript course!)
                and then someone mentioned AppAcademy Open as another (free) resource - and well, here I am! (Third time's the charm, or how's that
                saying?)
                We got the task of building our first website (HTML and CSS Capstone project) with some specific requirements, and since - so far -
                I have no idea what kind of website to build, I thought I'll share some pieces of my coding journey.
                Enjoy!
            </p>
